# Organization
org_name: Beta Theta Pi Fraternity
org_bio: >
    Here at the Beta Delta chapter of Beta Theta Pi we continue to push our members to surpass the status quo. Our house sets high standards for academic excellence; maintaining above a 3.4 house GPA.  In addition, our membership maintains 20 hours of community service per brotherâ€”well beyond any other fraternity on Cornell's campus. Finally, and most importantly, our chapter holds leadership on campus, and in life, as important as the brothers we stand beside. Here at Beta Delta we seek purpose in building men of principle.    Though many current houses pride themselves on purely social events, we strive to produce some of the most successful men that graduate from Cornell University. Yes, we do have fun; however, our members regard social events as only one piece of being a successful fraternity. Our brotherhood builds better men without breaking them down. It is each brother's goal to produce well-rounded and talented leaders on Cornell's campus and in the world.
