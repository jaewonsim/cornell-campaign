    <p>SEC empowers students to build a career in social and environmental impact. We believe that every student brings a crucial perspective that can shape a brighter tomorrow, and keep our resources and events open to all! We serve as a catalyst in the Cornell entrepreneurship community in three respects:</p>
    <ul><li><strong>Education</strong>: SEC provides educational resources so that students in a variety of professional pursuits can learn about impact investment, social consulting, social entrepreneurship, and social design.</li>
    <li><strong>Innovation</strong>: SEC fosters creativity and supports innovative solutions to social and environmental problems through ideathons, workshops, competitions, and other events.</li>
    <li><strong>Community</strong>. Most importantly, SEC creates community by providing opportunities for students to meet others in our universityâ€™s diverse student body and learn from a collective pool of knowledge.</li></ul>
    <h3>GOALS</h3>
    <ol><li>Build a community of at least 100 students exploring the intersection of impact and business</li>
    <li>Grow our newsletter to ~1000 subscribers</li>
